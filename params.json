{"name":"Eco","tagline":"Eco - A PHP Framework","body":"## Eco - A PHP Framework\r\n\r\nEco is a light, ready to use, [PHP](https://php.net) Framework. It has the core things you'll need to start developing your *Server Side Web App*.\r\n\r\nWith a low need of configuration is close to a *just upload and develop* framework.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nWhat are the requirements of Eco? The requirements of this PHP Framework are really simple:\r\n\r\n* PHP VersiÃ³n: 5.3+.\r\n* Apache's Mod_Rewrite module activated.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nEco is configure-friendly so there's just a few things you need to change to get ready and put your hands on developing your app.\r\n\r\n### Configuring the App Routes\r\n\r\nTo start configuring your own *App Routes* you just need to access the following library: `lib.Router.php` and in the *Method* called `AppRoutes()` you'll find the following `Array`:\r\n\r\n    $this->ColeccionRutas = [\r\n        'index' => [ 'argumentos' => [ 'titulo' => 'EcoFramework DashBoard' ] ],\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to create a route for a view that will be used for your users profile. We can handle it this way:\r\n\r\n    $this->ColeccionRutas = [\r\n        'index' => [ 'argumentos' => [ 'titulo' => 'EcoFramework DashBoard' ] ],\r\n        'user' => [ 'argumentos' => [ 'titulo' => 'User Profile' ] ]\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nAnd that's all folks, your route is now ready to be used but there's a last thing to prepare because the route is defined but... Which view will it take? At this moment: none. We need to head to `Views` folder and create a *View* called `view.user.php` and fill it with your `HTML` and `PHP`.","google":"UA-47287367-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
